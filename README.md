# MobileEditor

This is a PDF editor designed to work on mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc). It was created by Timothy Kozlov and Niranjan Sahi and is intellectual property of DashQuill Technologies LLC.

We have decided to open-source because there don't seem to be many good editors out there, and it might be useful to some people. If you're interested in using any code from this repository for your personal project, go ahead. If you want to use it for commercial purposes, please contact us at contact@dashquill.com to get permission.
